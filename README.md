# Planning
    Originally, I planned to make a calculator that could do a hefty amount of calculatoions based off 
    of formulas and such, similar to symbolab.comI later realized that this would be too much work for 
    the time given, so I decided I would make a simple scientific calculator instead. 

    I attempted to create a converter that would, ideally, be able to convert any base to any other base 
    numbering system from base-2 to base-16. This did not go as planned, however, as I ran out of time 
    before I could finish the scripting for the converter.

    The webpages which make up this project consist of:
    
         A Home page.

         A Page with a simple scientific calculator, where you can do simple trig functions, sqrt, sqare,
         log, as well as multiply by pi and e.

         An unfinished page that will later be scripted to convert between numbering systems up to base-16.

    In the future I plan to: 

        Finish the script for the converter.

        Work on a more sophisticated calculator that has a lot more capabilities, possibly a programmer's 
        calculator as well.
